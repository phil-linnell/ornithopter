# TODO

* [ ] Smoothness
* [ ] Simplify token management, i.e. just two.
* [ ] Merge transforms
* [ ] Cubic-b√©zier

* [ ] Time component permeations

* [ ] More multiple animation-units

* [ ] Predict smoothness (apply statistical computation to compare original curve vs generated)

make test TEST_FILES=tests/color_test.js


Next time

Total duration not working? See smoothness-02 test
Look into our computation regarding time. Start by splitByTime, then test how we implement time re keyframe generation.
So remove tests and start deep down.
