# TODO

* [ ] Smoothness
* [ ] Simplify token management, i.e. just two.
* [ ] Merge transforms
* [ ] Cubic-b√©zier

* [ ] Time component permeations

* [ ] More multiple animation-units

* [ ] Predict smoothness (apply statistical computation to compare original curve vs generated)

make test TEST_FILES=tests/color_test.js


Next time

Walk through ornithopter.js and re-implement smoothness
n = smoothness + tokens.length - 1
